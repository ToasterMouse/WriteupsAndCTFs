To begin we'll head to [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).

Then we'll select the first link on the menu to the left: `bandit`.

Make sure to read the `Note for beginners` section as it will help you get started. The idea here is that we need to complete a level to get the password to the next level.

We can start the first level by selecting it from the menu on the left.

Each level will give you an introduction and a hint for the commands you should use as well as some useful references.
