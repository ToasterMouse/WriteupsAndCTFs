The `natas` rooms are all about server-side web-based security.

We'll be touching on the basic concepts of web security as well as delving into a little bit of coding with `Python`.

As per the introduction page we must know that there is no SSH login (we will be dealing with each level through their web page only), that each level has access to the password for the next level and that all passwords are stored on the server at `/etc/natas_webpass`.
