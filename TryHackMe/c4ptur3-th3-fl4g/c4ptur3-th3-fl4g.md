# Translation & Shifting

Translate, shift and decode the following. Answers are all case sensitive.

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
c4n y0u c4p723 7h3 f149?
```

This is pretty easy to decode as it resembles English fairly close.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
can you capture the flag?
```

This "encoding" type is:

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
13375p34k
```

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```

```

This is in binary. We can use `python` or an online converter like `CyberChef` to decode it.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
lets try some binary out!
```

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Binary
```

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$

```

It looks like some form of `base` encoding. We can use `CyberChef` to test which one by cycling in each `From BaseN` module.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
base32 is super common in CTF's
```

The encoding type is: `Base32`.

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Base32
```

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==
```

Again, let's try cycling in each `From BaseN` module in `CyberChef`.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.
```

The encoding type is: `Base64`.

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Base64
```

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```

```

We can use `CyberChef` again to decode `hex` with the `From Hex` module.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
hexadecimal or base16?
```

The encoding type is: `Hexadecimal`.

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Hex
```

---

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!
```

This is a common "encryption" type, `rot13`. We can use `CyberChef`, `caesar` or `tr` to reveal the answer.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
Rotate me 13 places!
```

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Rot13
```

---

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
*@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX
```

This looks like a substitution cipher. We can use `CyberChef`, once again, to try some types.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
You spin me right round baby right round (47 times)
```

The encoding type is: `ROT47`.

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Rot47
```

---

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -. . -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.
```

This is `Morse Code`. We can use an online tool to solve it.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
TELECOMMUNICATION  ENCODING
```

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Morse Code
```

${\color{orange}Cipher:}$
```
85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68
```

To me, this looks like `Decimal`. `CyberChef` can help us to convert it.

${\color{limegreen}Answer:}$
```
Unpack this BCD
```

${\color{cyan}Encoding:}$
```
Decimal
```

This last one was a little trickier as it is encoded in a few different types. We can find the process to decode this cipher with `CyberChef`.

Here, to decode the message we used the modules: 

`From Base64` => `From Morse Code` => `From Binary` => `ROT47` => `From Decimal`.

# Spectrograms

${\color{cyan}Quote:}$
```
A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies within time.
When applied to an audio signal, spectograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams.
When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.
```


Here we download a file called `secretaudio.wav`. The name of this section is a hint. Open the file in `audacity` and select the file name on the audio sub-menu and open the `spectrogram`.

# Steganography

${\color{cyan}Quote:}$
```
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video
within another file, message, image or video.
```

We are given a file called `stegosteg.jpg` to download.

![[ctf_03.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToasterMouse/WriteupsAndCTFs/main/TryHackMe/c4ptur3-th3-fl4g/images/ctf_03.png)

A great tool for `steganography` challenges is `stegseek`. It can be used to crack a `steg` password and extract the contents hidden in a file. Here we don't need to crack a password but we can still use it to extract whatever is inside this file. Then we'll open it with `cat`.

# Security Through Obscurity

${\color{cyan}Quote:}$
```
Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or
implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.
```

Basically, it's a way to make something secure by hiding the "true" form of something. 

This one is actually very simple and involves one of the first checks to ever perform on a file when doing file analysis/forensics.

We will download a file called `meme.jpg`.

${\color{orange}Task:}$
```
Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
```

A way to get a filename from a file is to use the `strings` command. If the filename has been obscured (by changing it's name, for example), there is a probability that the original filename still exists somewhere in the file. Either through strings or `exif` data.
